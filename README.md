# pet-app

__General Assembly | Web Development Immersive__

Unit 3 | MEAN Stack - Group Project

by Allyson Finck and Natalie Wolff

Deployed at: https://thepetproject.herokuapp.com/


__Concept__
We are both obsessed with our pets (as is evident in our profile photos) and wanted to work on a project that coincided with our passion for animals and animal rescue. The basic concept of the app is for people to be able to search for a specific animal in their location that is available for adoption. The search options of location, type, breed, size, sex and age allow users to find the perfect animal for their home.

We used the official Petfinder API which proved to be the biggest challenge of the whole project. With only an introduction to APIs given to us in lecture, using a full-on complicated API with multiple search paramaters proved difficult for both of us and also gave our TA some difficulty. Allyson was ultimately responsible for figuring out the syntax and formatting of the API on our project and saved us from having to scrap the entire API portion and go to our backup plan of using seeded data to simulate the API information.

__UNSOLVED PROBLEMS__

The final problem that we were unable to solve was allowing users to add pets to their profile page.
